Class materials for FSH556: Spatio-temporal models for ecologists in spring 2018 at UW

## Recordings
I will be posting recordings for lectures/labs (assuming I don't forget to record them) and posting them on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@fishstats5375/videos

## TMB
We will be using Template Model Builder in every lecture/lab and for all homeworks/projects.  Please install prior to attending the first class, following instructions at: https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/geostatistical_delta-GLMM/wiki/Steps-to-install-TMB
